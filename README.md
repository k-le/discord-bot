# Discord Bot written in Python
Python project to develop a Discord bot (end goal is to have a few commands and functions, such as telling the weather, playing music from YouTube, recording notes). 
This project's purpose is to have fun and also get a feel for working with various APIs (Discord, OpenWeatherMap, YouTube, SmartyStreets). 
I'm also trying to implement some Clean Code concepts as well as developing a habit to read documentation and also making my own documentation as 
I move forward with this project.
